# Buffer

**In computer science, a data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of memory used to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another.**

## For node specific defination

**Buffer objects are used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. Many Node.js APIs support Buffers.**

**The Buffer class is a subclass of JavaScript's `Uint8Array` class and extends it with methods that cover additional use cases. Node.js APIs accept plain `Uint8Array` wherever Buffers are supported as well.**

### Uint8Array:

- _The Uint8Array typed array represents an array of 8-bit unsigned integers. It is the subclass of `TypedArray`_
