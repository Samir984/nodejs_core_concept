# Buffer
**In computer science, a data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of memory used to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another.**

## For node specific defination
**Buffer objects are used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. Many Node.js APIs support Buffers.**

**The Buffer class is a subclass of JavaScript's Uint8Array class and extends it with methods that cover additional use cases. Node.js APIs accept plain Uint8Array wherever Buffers are supported as well.**
